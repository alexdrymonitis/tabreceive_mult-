# [tabreceive_mult~]
## a Pure Data external that receives values from multiple tables simultaneously

[tabreceive_mult~] can receive values from various tables at the same time. It can also set an amplitude value for each table, and a ramp time for that amplitude set in milliseconds, in a [line~] fashion.

This external is written by IOhannes m zm√∂lnig and Alexandros Drymonits, based on Pd's source code.
